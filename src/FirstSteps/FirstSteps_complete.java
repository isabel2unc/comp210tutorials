          ls --> lists the items in the current directory
          cd ___ --> opens a directory (where ___ is replaced by the directory name)
          cd .. --> closes the directory and moves you back to the higher-level folder

    OR

    1. Left-click on the FirstSteps package (folder) on the left.
    2. Select "Open In" --> "Finder"
    3. In Finder, left-click on the FirstSteps folder.
